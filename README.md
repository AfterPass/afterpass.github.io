What happens to your cryptocurrency when you kick the bucket?

Legacy planning for your digital assets is insecure. Most solutions involve writing down your passkeys and keeping them in a “safe” place, or giving them to a trusted person.

This defeats the purpose of having a private key, right?

And it’s not just your Bitcoin and Ethereum. What will happen to all your photos, your videos, your blogs?
Whether you want this information passed on to a loved one, or wiped from existence, AfterPass has a secure solution for you.

You can store cryptography keys, social media details, files, and photos with AfterPass to be released to whomever you like after you die.

Our unique multi-stage authentication system will automatically detect when you’ve left this mortal plane and - after reaching out to ensure you’re not just on holiday - send this information out or purge it from existence, if that’s what you want.

AfterPass uses blockchain technology and split keys to make sure nobody except you can access your secure information until the time is right.

You have complete control over your own information and what happens with it after you die. AfterPass cannot access your blockchain-encrypted data, and neither can anyone else.

Our code is open-source, so you can review it for your own peace of mind.
