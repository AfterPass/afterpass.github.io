## What happens to your cryptocurrency and online accounts when you kick the bucket?

Legacy planning for your digital assets is insecure. Most cryptocurrency inheritance involves writing down your passkeys and keeping them in a “safe” place, or giving them to a trusted person with instructions.

This defeats the purpose of having a private key, right?

And your digital assets are far more than just the contents of your cryptocurrency wallet. Your photos, videos, and blogs on your online accounts all have value. What will happen to them after you’re gone?

Whether you want your account passed on to a loved one or wiped from existence, AfterPass has a secure solution for you.

AfterPass is your gateway to secure, long term, digital key backups. The integration of blockchain technology and split keys ensures that nobody except you is able to access your information until the time is right.

Our unique multi-stage authentication system will automatically detect when you’ve shuffled off this mortal coil, and - after reaching out to ensure you’re not just on holiday - your information will be taken care of in your pre-stated preferred manner.

At all times, you have complete control over your information and what happens with it. AfterPass cannot access your blockchain-encrypted data, and neither can anyone else until the time is right.

Transparency is one of our highest priorities, so we’ve made our code open-source for you to review for your own peace of mind.
